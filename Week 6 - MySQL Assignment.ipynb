    "##### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "##### Sol:- \n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and management. It serves as a repository for various types of information, and databases are commonly used in applications ranging from simple data storage to complex systems that require high-performance data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL databases. Here's a brief differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### SQL Databases:\n",
    "a). SQL databases are typically used for applications with complex queries and transactions, where data integrity is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "b). Structure: SQL databases are relational databases, meaning they use a structured schema with tables to organize and represent data. Each table consists of rows and columns, and the relationships between tables are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "c). Data Model: SQL databases follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "d). Scalability: Vertical scaling (adding more power to an existing server) is the common way to scale SQL databases. It may involve upgrading the hardware to handle increased loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "a). NoSQL databases are often chosen for their scalability and flexibility, making them suitable for applications with large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data and where high performance is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "b). Structure: NoSQL databases are non-relational and often use a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph databases. The structure can be more flexible, allowing for dynamic schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "c). Data Model: NoSQL databases may not strictly adhere to the ACID properties. Instead, they often prioritize scalability and performance, allowing for eventual consistency rather than immediate consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "d). Scalability: NoSQL databases are generally more horizontally scalable, which means that to handle increased loads, you can add more servers to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of NoSQL databases: MongoDB (document-oriented), Cassandra (wide-column store), Redis (key-value store), Neo4j (graph database)."
