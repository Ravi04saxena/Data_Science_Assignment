    "#### Q1. What is an Exception in python ? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "#### Sol. -->Exceptions are an integral part of Python's error-handling mechanism. They provide a way to catch and handle errors, allowing you to write code that can recover from unexpected situations or display meaningful error messages to users.\n",
    "#### -->When an exception occurs, Python raises an exception object, which contains information about the error.\n",
    "#### -->Below is the some common exceptions in Python include :- \n",
    "a). NameError: Raised when you try to access a variable or function that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "b). TypeError: Raised when you use a variable or operator with an inappropriate data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "c). ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct data type but an inappropriate value.\n",
    "\n",
    "d). ZeroDivisionError: Raised when you attempt to divide by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "e). FileNotFoundError: Raised when you try to open or access a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "f). IndexError: Raised when you try to access an index that is out of range for a list or other iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "g). KeyError: Raised when you try to access a dictionary key that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "h). AttributeError: Raised when you try to access an attribute that doesn't exist for an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### --> Difference between Exceptions and syntax -\n",
    "a). Syntax Error: Syntax errors are related to the structure and grammar of your Python code. They occur when you write code that violates Python's syntax rules, making it impossible for the interpreter to understand and execute your program. Examples include missing colons, incorrect indentation, or using undefined variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions : Exceptions, on the other hand, are runtime errors that occur during the execution of a program. They typically result from unexpected conditions or problems that arise while the program is running, such as dividing by zero, attempting to access a non-existent file, or encountering a data type mismatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "b). Syntax Error: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before your program starts executing. If your code contains a syntax error, Python will not run your program, and you will receive an error message immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Exceptions occur during the execution of the program. They are not necessarily known in advance and can be caused by various dynamic factors while the program is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "c). Syntax Error: You need to fix syntax errors in your code before you can run the program. These errors are usually caught by the interpreter and displayed as error messages, making it clear where the issue is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks. You can anticipate potential exceptions, catch them, and implement error-handling code to gracefully recover from the error, display meaningful messages, or take alternative actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "d). Syntax Error: Examples of syntax errors include forgetting to close a parenthesis, using an invalid variable name, or having improper indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError (division by zero), FileNotFoundError (trying to access a non-existent file), and IndexError (attempting to access an out-of-range list index)."

    "#### Q2. What happened when an exception is not handled ? Explain with an example.\n",
    "#### Sol. When an exception is not handled in a program, it can lead to unexpected and often undesirable consequences. Here's what typically happens when an exception is not handled in a program:\n",
    "\n",
    "Termination of the Program: An unhandled exception will cause the program to terminate or crash. This abrupt termination can disrupt the normal flow of the program and potentially result in data loss or other issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Messages: When an exception occurs and is not caught and handled by the program, an error message is often displayed. This error message can provide information about the type of exception, its location in the code, and sometimes a stack trace that shows the call stack leading up to the exception. These error messages can be helpful for debugging but may also expose sensitive information or provide potential entry points for attackers if not properly managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Leaks: Unhandled exceptions can lead to resource leaks, such as unclosed files, network connections, or memory leaks. This can degrade system performance and may result in unintended resource exhaustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incomplete or Inconsistent State: If an exception occurs but is not handled, it can leave the program in an incomplete or inconsistent state. This means that some operations may have partially executed, and data structures may be left in an undefined or invalid state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Loss: In some cases, unhandled exceptions can result in data loss. For example, if an exception occurs during a critical file write operation and is not handled, the data being written may be lost or corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Vulnerabilities: Unhandled exceptions can pose a security risk, as they may reveal internal implementation details or error messages that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or launch attacks on the system."

    "#### Sol.\n",
    "Custom exceptions, also known as user-defined exceptions, are exceptions that you create by defining your own exception classes in Python. These custom exceptions allow you to handle specific error conditions or exceptional cases in your code, providing a more structured and meaningful way to deal with errors unique to your application. To create a custom exception, you typically define a new class that inherits from Python's built-in Exception class or one of its subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Need of Custom Exceptions :-\n",
    "Custom exceptions allow you to define exception types that are specific to your application or module\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions enable you to provide meaningful error messages that describe the problem in a way that is more helpful to developers and maintainers of your code\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating custom exceptions, you can organize and structure your error handling more effectively. It's particularly useful when you have a large codebase or complex software projects with multiple modules or packages."
